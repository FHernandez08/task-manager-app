# Task Manager App

### A simple page that can help keep track of all your tasks that has to be completed. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Features:
- Can add tasks
- Delete tasks
- Edit tasks
- Turn the page either dark mode or light mode

### Reflection
Building this project was difficult to start with, there were topics that I needed to practice in more to fully be able to add the features needed to complete this project. Some of these topics were localStorage, filter and map methods, and event listener. After completing project, I've gained more confidence in myself with JavaScript to be able to add more features to this application when the time comes.

### Future Improvements
As my journey into becoming a great full-stack developer continues, I will comeback to this project and will be adding backend features such as user login and task managment along with backend functionality. To complete this I will be using Node.js and Express to complete this. Please look forward to it!!!

### Final Update & Notes
The project is finally completed!!!!! After a few weeks of being able to work on this project, it's finally completed to the way I idealized building this project. Following the future improvements that I wanted to include. These are the features that were added:

- Working user login function that will give out the first and last name of the user if the credentials entered at the login form are successful.
- Implement security measures to ensure that the user is protected from creating an account to using the account, which was completed by implementing jsonwebtoken and middleware.
- Connected the user's data from the account creation to a database on MongoDB, which is used to check when an user is trying to login and access the account.

Overall, this project was a fun experience to take a part of. I still have more to learn, especially on the backend portion of web development, but this project allowed me to gain more confidence in being able to do more projects similar to this when dealing with databases, important information and security.

Looking forward to more projects similar to this so stay tuned!!!
