# Notes from days working on project

### 6/4/2025 - Implemented login/regiter features to project
Worked on adding the user login feature into the project, that would be using the information entered in the forms and doing one of two things:
    1. Verifying the information submitted to login using a token created by middleware to be used to sign
    2. Creating a new user which includes the information submitted along with a token secret that will be generated once the user is created

The second part is being worked on, which I will work on it either tomorrow (6/5/2025) or Friday (6/6/2025). I have to spend time on reviewing the material along with understanding what's going in the project because it has been a while since I worked on middleware and authentication and I feel like I forgot it a bit and I don't want to reference to projects I have worked on in the past to kinda like cheat my way into completing this project.

I feel like by reviewing it and being able to understanding to what's going on in the project, will be huge in the long run, especially with a huge project coming up about building my own e-commerce application and I will include features such as user login, databases, APIs, frontend & backend code along with security from authentication and middleware.

I will decide before going to bed if I would work on it again tomorrow, but I am keen on reviewing the materials and taking notes.
